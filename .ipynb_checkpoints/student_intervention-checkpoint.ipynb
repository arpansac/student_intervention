    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",

    "From the experiments I've conducted using the 3 models which are Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), SVM is the one which I'd choose as the single best model because it produces the highest F-Score (test) of 0.7838 when used with a training data of 300. Whereas KNN and GNB produced 0.7801 and 0.7634 respectively. The thing worth noting here is that even though KNN had a higher F-score of 0.8809 on the training data as compared to 0.8761 of SVM for the same data set, the latter produced better results on the testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, coming to picking out the best model, we have to consider various other factors such as the time taken to train the model and the time it takes for that model to predict the outcome along with the F-score we've used earlier. In this case, GNB which is known to perform well with data which has independent and limited set of features, outperforms KNN and SVM in terms of the prediction time. Although the training time of KNN is better, but when we consider the difference in prediction time, GNB is far ahead. Considering a certain level of growth in the dataset, say about 5 folds, it will still perform better as the set of features remain the same."

Right now these are the values which define whether a student will fail or pass. Now I want to predict whether a new 3rd student will fail or pass. KNN matches the different features of the 3rd student with the first and second student and it puts the 3rd student into the class of the student with whom the maximum features match (let's assume it matches with the passing student). Now there are 2 students in the passing category and 1 in the failing. Now say there's another new student whom we want to predict about, then we repeat the last process, the only difference is that if the same count of features match with both the classes, then the prediction will be passing because of the majority of neighbours in the list of matching categories."
